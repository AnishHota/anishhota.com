                    <p>For a long time, I was against the idea of 'self-promotion'. This was mostly since I did not
                        understand the term properly.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-12 container blog-content">
                    <p>
                        For a vast period of my life, I was afraid of showcasing any skills whatsoever. I still am.
                        Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that I have hidden skills or skills that are worth watching.
                        I am just afraid to put myself out there however I am. After so many introspections and beating
                        myself up, I realized nobody cares. I don't mean it in a bad way but rather in a very freeing
                        way.
                    </p>
                    <p> Why do people care so much about others? I have seen people never publishing their blog posts
                        because they think they aren't good enough. On what measures are you comparing yourself?. For
                        example, I coded this website myself. It's not the best portfolio website out there. Heck, I
                        won't be in the top 50% either. But it's mine. Isn't that enough? I am not the best Software
                        Engineer out there either. That doesn't mean I will stop pursuing it. Own what you have done,
                        what you want to do, and what you are doing at this very moment. It's not like people care any
                        less. For what it's worth, people will even respect you more for putting yourself out there.
                        Because that's something they wanted to do it themselves for a long time and not being able to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I recently saw a portfolio website of someone, and it wasn't pretty. It was very basic but it
                        worked. I realized that even if his website isn't pretty, he has still got a website, he is
                        showing his skills, he is putting himself out there. I started respecting him even more and then
                        forgot about it in a few days. Everyone else is the same, they will look at your work, either
                        praise it or criticize it and then move on. Nobody stays by your side criticizing the whole way.
                        Nobody cares that you have got the margin wrong. They will point it out and move on. Now, either
                        you can take their criticism and sulk. You can cry about how you made the worst mistake of your
                        life, somebody has noticed you haven't aligned the image properly and this is the end of your
                        life. Or you can just add that change to your to-do list, and handle it on your own time. That's
                        it.</p>

                    <p>So, I decided to buy my website domain on my birthday and just started working on it. I realized
                        there are certain kinds of stuff I want to showcase. Hence, I made different sections that are
                        relevant to me. The website is in its rudimentary stage. But you know the best thing about it, I
                        have my own goddamn website that I always dreamt of. I achieved one of my dreams. Isn't this
                        what life is all about? So, the real question here is What's stopping you from achieving your dreams?
